A collection of little one-liners I like. Some of these come from my parents, others have come from books, games or the internet.

#### About Life

> _Patience is a virtue_

Good advice for most things. Knowing when not to be patient can be helpful too.

> _A peak life is lived off-peak_

My dad likes this one, and I've generally found it to be true. Going at the busiest time is not usually the best time, and the best ideas aren't always the most popular ones.

> _Do what you love, and you'll never work another day in your life_

There are too many articles online hating on this one — if you're lucky enough to be able to do so, it's absolutely worth taking the time to find work that you're excited about. Keeps things interesting.

#### About Euchre

> _Don't trump your partner's ace_

If your partner has already put an ace on a trick, they've probably got it, no need to trump it! Good Euchre strategy, and probably a good life strategy in general; a little bit of trust can go a long way!

> _Never let a trick go by you can take_

From what I've gathered, this isn't always the winning strategy in Euchre, but 99% of the time will make for the right play. Take the opportunites that're handed to you!
